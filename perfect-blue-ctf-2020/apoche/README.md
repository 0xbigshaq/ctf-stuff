# Solution

First, we discover the ``/secret/`` directory using ``/robots.txt``:

The ``.txt`` files contains the site admin's "journal", which supposed to give us hints:

Today I started drafting this cool new C webserver, named APOCHE! OWO 

(Totally not related to the naming of apache). Pretty sure they stole my name
because I came up with this name so many years ago! https://xkcd.com/827/

I decided to dedicate my server to the hosting of some free weeb pics OWO.

Today was a dull and boring day, still working out this server, which I realize
is taking on a heavy toll on top of regular univ work.

Totally been painful to try to complete this work.

Hopefully, one day it will be functional. I might get more time over the break.

Hi, I've finally perfected my new C webserver (after working 10 or so days on
this), very excited to see it to use.

There's still a couple of bugs I need to kink out, but it should be fine, right?

Nothing at all to exploit :^)

Regrettably, I haven't really tried testing it with a large load yet... :( maybe
when my website gets popular, I'll let the users to test it.

Oh came back to this old project, looks like from the logs somebody has been
hacking into my /secret/ folder ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ . Not funny.

Okay I decided to put my secret info into /var/www/secret instead :P

It's the second day of the NEW YEAER! quite exciting

I just noticed somebody was trying to access my /var/www/secret data ðŸ˜¢
so I decided to filter out '/' and '.' characters in the beginning of the path.

Maybe I should stop logging stuff here... not safe

From the txt files, we can understand that this is an "apoche" server written in C (probablly just a vulnerable apache module). 

First thing I tried was a directory traversal:

Nice, it worked.

To get the flag, simply pull the _Apoche_ binary by leaking ``/proc/self/exe``:
